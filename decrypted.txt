the mystery of google’s four-storey barges has finally been solved, with the search giant announcing that it will be using the structures as educational spaces.

the first barge appeared in san francisco bay and a second, identical boat was spotted later in portland. each is 250ft long, 72ft wide and covered in scaffolding.

initial reports suggested that they might be linked with a patent filed by google in 2009 for a “water-based data centre,” but the company has laughed off these suggestions.

"google barge ... a floating data center? a wild party boat? a barge housing the last remaining dinosaur? sadly, none of the above," says the statement. “although it's still early days and things may change, we're exploring using the barge as an interactive space where people can learn about new technology.”
